This repository focuses on fine-tuning Llama2 for music generation tasks. The process involves converting MIDI files to a text-based representation using `midi_textefinal.py` script. The text representation encodes musical notes as quadruplets, where each variable is separated by a colon (`:`). Within each quadruplet, the four variables represent:

- `p`: Pitch
- `v`: Velocity
- `d`: Duration
- `t`: Time

After converting MIDI files to text, we proceed to fine-tune the Llama2 model for improved music generation performance.

## Usage

### Converting a MIDI File to Text Representation

To convert a MIDI file to text format, use the `midi_textefinal.py` 

### Converting Text to MIDI File

To convert text to a MIDI file, use the `text_to_midi.py` 
### Generating Music
